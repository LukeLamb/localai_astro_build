## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Start Small:**
- Launch with 5-10 channels, add more later
- You can always add channels based on demand

**Seed Early:**
- Invite 10-20 friends before public launch
- Empty servers feel dead - seed activity first

**Be Active:**
- First 2 weeks are critical
- Post daily, respond to everything
- Set the tone and culture

**Automate:**
- Use bots to reduce your workload
- But don't over-automate personality out

**Iterate:**
- Get feedback constantly
- Adjust based on how people use it
- Kill dead channels, add requested ones

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Too many channels at start (overwhelming)  
❌ Not enough moderation (spam takes over)  
❌ Over-reliance on bots (feels impersonal)  
❌ Launching to empty server (dead vibes)  
❌ Not being active as founder (sets bad example)  
❌ Allowing financial advice (legal issues)  
❌ No clear rules (chaos)
