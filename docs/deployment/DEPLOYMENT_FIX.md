# Deployment Fix Guide

## 🔧 **Issue Resolved**

**Problem:** The website was showing up blank on https://localaifinance.com/ despite working locally.

**Root Cause:** There was a duplicate CSS link tag in `Layout.astro` that was referencing the source CSS file directly (`/src/styles/global.css`) instead of allowing Astro to bundle and link the CSS properly.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed incorrect CSS link tag** from `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
2. **Kept proper CSS import** in the frontmatter: `import "../styles/global.css";`
3. **Verified CSS bundling** is working correctly

### Result:
- ✅ CSS is now properly bundled into `/_astro/index.VNyUH0cA.css`
- ✅ HTML correctly references the bundled CSS file
- ✅ All Tailwind classes and custom styles are working
- ✅ Build process generates proper production assets

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

### For Netlify Deployment:

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Publish Directory**: `dist`
3. **Deploy**: The latest commit with the CSS fix has been pushed to GitHub

### For Manual Deployment:

1. Run `npm run build` to generate the `dist` folder
2. Upload the entire contents of the `dist` folder to your web server
3. Ensure the server can serve static files from `/_astro/` directory

## 🔍 **Verification**

The fixed website should now display:
- ✅ Proper navigation with logo and menu
- ✅ Hero section with gradient backgrounds
- ✅ All styled components (buttons, cards, etc.)
- ✅ Responsive design across all devices
- ✅ Blog and contact pages fully functional

## 📝 **Technical Details**

### What Was Wrong:
```html
<!-- This was causing the issue -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/styles/global.css" />
```

### What's Now Working:
```html
<!-- Astro now generates this automatically -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/_astro/index.VNyUH0cA.css">
```

### CSS Import Pattern (Correct):
```astro
---
import "../styles/global.css"; // ✅ This bundles CSS properly
---
```

## ⚡ **Deploy Now**

Your GitHub repository has been updated with the fix. If your hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) is connected to the GitHub repo, it should automatically redeploy with the fixed version.

The website should now work properly on https://localaifinance.com/ 🎉
