# 🚀 LocalAI Finance - Complete Project Roadmap 2025

**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025
**Vision:** AI-Powered Trading Education Platform with Gamified Progression
**Launch Target:** January 2026 Beta

---

## 🎯 CORE VISION (Clarified)

### What We're Building

**A gamified trading education platform powered by 4 AI agents:**

1. **Advisor Agent** - Market analysis and trade recommendations
2. **Backtest Agent** - Historical strategy validation
3. **Pattern Agent** - Technical pattern recognition
4. **Risk Agent** - Portfolio risk management

### The Journey

```bash
Level 1-25:   Education Only → Learn fundamentals, no trading
Level 26-50:  Paper Trading → Practice with fake money + AI agents
Level 51-100: Live Trading → Real money with full AI agent support
```

### Why Gamification?

- **Trust Issue:** People don't trust financial platforms
- **Education Gap:** 95% of traders fail due to lack of knowledge
- **Solution:** Make learning fun, enforce progression gates, build competency before risk
